I'm Cathryn Stenson - a human living in Seattle*. I spend my time as a software engineer, as a writer, as an artist, as a cities advocate, as a climate crisis awareness-raiser, and just generally as an enby trans lesbian living in the PNW. In a career what I look for is the ability to empower people - to give more people more tools to do better things more easily. I'm currently @tableau - everyone's favorite Seattle-based data visualization company.

> \* = I'd like to acknowledge that Seattle - and my home - are on the unceded ancestral lands of the Duwamish people. A people that are still here, continuing to honor and bring light to their ancient heritage. If you live in Seattle, consider paying rent to the Duwamish Tribe - please, read more at [Real Rent Duwamish](https://www.realrentduwamish.org).
