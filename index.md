# cathryn stenson

hello! i'm cathryn, an enby trans human. if you talk about me, please use "she" or "they" pronouns. i currently live on the shores of the salish sea, in an area that has been inhabited by the duwamish people since the end of the last glacial period - also known more recently as seattle. i'm a software developer, writer, photographer, artist, wonderer, and wanderer. this site serves as a portfolio and online presence of sorts.
